## Dashboard + Admin
- Launch your developer tools on your browser
- main.js will lead your path
- Use keywords (path: can help you)

## Login Admin
- Open up your proxy (ZAP or Burp Site) to capture a request
- Try any username/password combination
- Change the username for the most common way of SQLi payload

## Database Schema
- Start your proxy
- Use the search field to try to generate a common error (SQLi-related)
- Check how it works within your proxy
- Did you know what is the table that keeps all the schema of the database? (You need to find out how to build the right payload)
- Remember that you need to know the exact number of columns inside the table to make the right query
- Hint: https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html

## Login Jim
- Also another SQLi
- Fire up your proxy
- Get Jim's email address
- What about rainbow tables? - http://project-rainbowcrack.com/charset.htm

## Login Bender
- Find out Bender's email address
- sqlmap could be a tool to use... but not this time
- Just the easiest SQLi payload

## Ephimeral Accountant
- Try to log in with a username ' and any password while checking the network developer tools tab
- Understand the Response
- We need to understand the Users table and create a UNION query that works
- Try to construct your payload... if not just use UNION SELECT * FROM (SELECT 100 as 'id', '' as 'username', 'acc0unt4nt@juice-sh.op' as 'email', 'BHP' as 'password', 'accounting' as 'role', '1000' as 'deluxeToken', '192.168.1.1' as 'lastLoginIp' , '/assets/public/images/uploads/default.svg' as 'profileImage', '' as 'totpSecret', 1 as 'isActive', '2024-07-16 07:07:07.777 +00:07' as 'createdAt', '2024-07-16 07:08:08.888 +00:07' as 'updatedAt', null as 'deletedAt')--

## Christmas Special
- Capture with your proxy a request related to some product search
- Make some SQLi
- What about creating an account and adding an item to the basket?
- And then... you can use that same request to achieve the objective

## NoSQL Manipulation
- Check the reviews
- Make a review for a product
- Check the mongo query operators at https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/
- Check the variables within a review
- Review the PATCH method for HTTP
- Change for id (according to the structure of the reviews)
- What would happen if I said $ne to id?

## User Credentials
- You already know what kind of request you need ;)
